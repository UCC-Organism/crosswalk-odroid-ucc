## Building Apks

	source setenv.sh

	python make_apk.py --enable-auto-update --enable-remote-debugging --manifest=[path-to-your-apps-manifest]

scripts/gyp/finalize_apk.py - line 34: os.path.join(android_sdk_root, 'build-tools', '20.0.0', 'zipalign'),

2. To install you built APK

	adb install name_of_the.apk
